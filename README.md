# EMPLOYEE_SALARY_PREDICTION
This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit that uses machine learning to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year based on census data from the UCI Adult Income Dataset.

ðŸš€ Features
Cleaned and preprocessed real-world data (adult.csv)

Feature encoding and outlier handling

Trained using Gradient Boosting Classifier

Interactive Streamlit UI for prediction

Model accuracy displayed after training

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model
Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Classifier

Preprocessing: Label Encoding for categorical features

Scaling: Min-Max Normalization

Model Evaluation: Accuracy on test data

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used is the Adult Census Income dataset which includes:

Age

Workclass

Education

Marital status

Occupation

Race

Gender

Capital gain/loss

Hours per week

Native country

Income label (<=50K or >50K)

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
Save/load trained model for faster reuse

Support multiple ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Enhance UI with charts (e.g., feature importance)
